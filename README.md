Ventata API
============

The Ventata API is a REST web service that accepts both JSON and XML. Use our API to integrate [dynamic pricing](https://ventata.com/) into any software application you are working with.


Overview
-------------------------

First, sign up for an API key at [Ventata.com](https://ventata.com/Ecommerce/Pricing).  

The idea behind ventata is you seed your pricing model with order data then call for a new price.   As a new order comes in, send it over and we'll incorporate it into your pricing model.   Then call for a new price.  This process allows us to maximize your profits in real time.


Sample Usage
-------------------------
* Digital Goods: Applications, Songs, Videos and In-Game purchases
* Ecommerce:  Regular ecommerce, drop-ship and flash sales
* Tickets and Events:  Use dynamic pricing to sell out your event and maximize revenue
* Traffic & Parking:  Use dynamic pricing to control capacity

Endpoints
-------------

* [Stores](https://github.com/Ventata/API/blob/master/endpoints/stores.md)
* [Products](https://github.com/Ventata/API/blob/master/endpoints/products.md)
* [Orders](https://github.com/Ventata/API/blob/master/endpoints/orders.md)
* [Company](https://github.com/Ventata/API/blob/master/endpoints/company.md)
* [Billing](https://github.com/Ventata/API/blob/master/endpoints/billing.md)


Authentication
--------------

Auth is done through an API Key on the end of the querystring.  When you first sign up, we'll send you a company API key.  With this key, you'll be able to create as many stores as you want.  Each store will get it's own unique api key returned in the response.     

**When do I use the Company API Key?**

When you are using Company, Stores or Billing endpoints.

**When do I use the Store API Key?**

When you are using Products or Orders endpoints.

**Why is it setup this way?**

You can have many stores to a single company and we can control how much access a store API Key has, if you just had a single point of authenticating then all stores would be able to access all the other stores' data.   With the multiple API key system, if you want contractors to integrate our API into one of your sites, you can give them the relavent Store API Key for it without having to give them access to all of your other stores.
